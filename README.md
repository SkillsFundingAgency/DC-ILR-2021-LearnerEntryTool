# DC-ILR-2021-LearnerEntryTool
This tool providers a human interface to create a schema valid ILR file.
Learners, Learning Delivery are the main entity types but the tool does allow for all ILR fields to be edited. The tool can also roll forward a 1920 format ILR file to 2021 format (so fields can be added and removed). The tool is stand alone and doesn't connect to the online systems.
