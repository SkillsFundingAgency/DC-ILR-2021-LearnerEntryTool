# ILR Learner Entry

The ILR Learner Entry Tool is provided free of charge by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) for organisations who do not have access to a data management system. This application enables users to create Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data in XML file format manually using a data entry interface.

The software is downloaded from the useful links area on the front page of the Hub.
